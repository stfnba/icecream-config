# icecream-config
For our Knowledge engineering class in our universities masters programme for business computer science we were supposed to enigneer a schema for a domain of our. Our chosen domain is ice cream, since summer is approaching rapidly.  Our domain description unfortunately is only available in german. We used CMap Tools, RDF Editor, Jekyll and Jekyll RDF.

The released site can be found under:

Advice: For the best experience install the font "Lie to me" from Dafont.

Why did we choose the topic of project to be icecream?

In the beginning of the semester we determined that it is the best idea to choose a domain that has a low barrier of understanding. Furthermore we chose as we did since we were only expecting our project to be presented in front of our semesters course and at a scientific conference. If it were clear right from the point we chose the knowledge domain we would definitely chosen a more academic topic. In the end our chosen domain benefited our study results though, since the low requirement in intellectual predisposition allowed us to make the technical implementation our focus. Whilst our results were not as impressive as our peers, who hold degrees in software and web development, we were able to fulfill all given requirements to our project. Since our programming capabilities were limited we put our emphasis on a realistic and appealing design that fits our chosen topic. We determined that this would be the wisest application of the hard skills we hold to display our capabilities of applying a knowledge transfer. 

What is the purpose of the static site we created using Liquid and Jekyll-RDF?

While the real world application of our static site is understandably questionable, it still holds the potential to be a tool for people with allergies, dietary restriction and alternative nutritional lifestyle choices that allows them to be informed about potentially harmful ingredients. To make this even more realistic there needs to be a way broader knowledge base displaying the nutritional contents of multiple manufacturers products. Furthermore the knowledge base needs to be expandable and peer reviewed by all users allowing it to rapidly grow holding reliable and correct information. As a quality of life change its recommended to implement a search bar allowing for a specific product by a specific manufacturer.
